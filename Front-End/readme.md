Table Management App

## Description

The Table Management App is a web application built with Node.js that allows users to create and manage tables dynamically. It provides a user-friendly interface to create tables, add rows and columns, view table details, and delete tables. The app is designed to simplify data management and organization for various use cases, such as data entry, spreadsheet-like functionality, and more.

## Features

- Table Creation: Users can create new tables by specifying the number of columns and providing a name for the table. The table structure is dynamically generated based on the user's input.
- Table Details: Users can view the details of a specific table, including its columns and rows. The table data is retrieved and manipulated using Node.js, ensuring efficient data management.
- Adding Rows: Users can add new rows to the table by entering data in the corresponding input fields. The new rows are dynamically appended to the existing table data.
- Adding Columns: Users have the ability to add new columns to the table. They can provide a name for the new column, and the table structure is updated accordingly.
- Deleting Tables: Users can delete a specific table, removing it permanently from the application's database. This action is irreversible and requires confirmation from the user.
